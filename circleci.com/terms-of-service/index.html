<p>THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE (THESE “<span class="definition">TOS</span>”) SHALL BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO EACH ORDER (AS DEFINED BELOW) BETWEEN CIRCLE INTERNET SERVICES, INC. A DELAWARE CORPORATION DBA CIRCLECI (“<span class="definition">CIRCLECI</span>”) AND THE LICENSEE IDENTIFIED THEREIN (“<span class="definition">LICENSEE</span>”). </p>
<p>YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE (AS DEFINED BELOW), WHETHER OR NOT AN ORDER HAS BEEN EXECUTED BETWEEN CIRCLECI AND YOU (OR AN ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT), IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED ON ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TOS.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND AND ABIDE BY THESE TOS.  IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS (AS DEFINED BELOW) WHO ACCESS THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF SUCH COMPANY OR ENTITY TO THESE TOS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TOS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
<ol class="legal">
  <li>

    <span class="title">Acceptance of Terms.</span> CircleCI provides its Continuous Integration Services to you through its web site located at https://circleci.com (the “<span class="definition">Site</span>”), pursuant to these TOS. The “<span class="definition">Service</span>” includes (a) the Site, (b) CircleCI’s continuous integration services and related technologies, and (c) all software (including the Software, as defined below), data, documentation, reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content made available through any of the foregoing (collectively referred to as the “<span class="definition">Content</span>”).  By entering into a Service order form, or other ordering document, web-based or email-based ordering mechanism or registration process (each an “<span class="definition">Order</span>”) or otherwise downloading, accessing or using the Service, Licensee unconditionally accepts and agrees to all of the terms of these TOS. Licensee represents that it has the authority to bind itself and its affiliates to the terms of these TOS, and, accordingly, the term “Licensee” shall refer to such entity.  If Licensee is an individual using the Service, the terms “Licensee” and “User” shall each apply to such individual using the Service for the purposes of these TOS. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be given the meaning set forth in the applicable Order. These TOS shall apply to all use by Licensee and Users (as defined below) of the Service. “<span class="definition">User</span>” means an individual who is authorized by Licensee to use the Service, for whom Licensee (or CircleCI at Licensee’s request) has supplied a user identification and password either manually or using a Non-CircleCI Application (as defined below) (e.g., GitHub via oAuth). Users may include, for example, Licensee’s employees, consultants, contractors and agents, and third parties that Licensee transacts business. CircleCI may change these TOS from time to time by providing Licensee and Users at least thirty (30) days notice either by emailing the email address associated with Licensee’s or User’s account or by posting a notice on the Service.  The revised TOS shall become effective thirty (30) days after CircleCI posts the updated TOS on the Service or e-mails Licensee and/or Users notice of a change to these TOS.  If any change to these TOS is not acceptable to a Licensee or a User, such User shall stop using the Service or, in the case of Licensee, shall send a cancellation e-mail to sayhi@circleci.com.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="deep-link-anchor" id="evaluations"></a>
    <span class="title">Evaluations.</span> From time to time, Licensee may be invited to try certain products at no charge for a free trial or evaluation period or if such products are not generally available to licensees (collectively, “<span class="definition">Evaluation Services</span>”). Evaluation Services will be designated or identified as beta, pilot, evaluation, trial or the like.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Evaluation Services are licensed for Licensee’s internal evaluation purposes only (and not for production use), are provided “as is” without warranty or indemnity of any kind, and may be subject to additional terms.  Unless otherwise stated, any Evaluation Service trial period shall expire thirty (30) days from the trial start date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, CircleCI may discontinue Evaluation Services at any time at its sole discretion and may never make any Evaluation Service generally available.  CircleCI will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Evaluation Service.

The manner in which Non-CircleCI Applications use, store and disclose Licensee and User information is governed solely by the policies of the third parties operating the Non-CircleCI Applications, and CircleCI shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party site or service that may be enabled within the Service.  In addition, CircleCI is not responsible for the accuracy, availability or reliability of any information, content, goods, data, opinions, advice or statements made available in connection with Non-CircleCI Applications. As such, CircleCI shall not be liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Non-CircleCI Applications.

    <span class="title">Fees and Payment.</span>
    <ol>
      <li>Licensee shall pay CircleCI the fees set forth in an Order in accordance with the terms set forth therein; provided that CircleCI may change any applicable fees upon thirty (30) days’ notice at any time and such new fees shall become effective for any subsequent renewal Term.  All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars.  Any payments more than thirty (30) days overdue will bear a late payment fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law.  In addition, Licensee will pay all taxes, shipping, duties, withholdings and the like, as well as all pre-approved out of pocket expenses incurred by CircleCI in connection with any consulting and/or support services, promptly upon invoice. If Licensee is paying any fees by credit card, Licensee shall provide CircleCI complete and accurate information regarding the applicable credit card.  Licensee represents and warrants that all such information is correct and that Licensee is authorized to use such credit card.  Licensee will promptly update its account information with any changes (for example, a change in billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.  Licensee hereby authorizes CircleCI to bill such credit card in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of these TOS and an Order, and Licensee further agrees to pay any charges so incurred.  Licensee will maintain, and CircleCI will be entitled to audit, any records relevant to Licensee’s use of the Service hereunder. CircleCI may audit such records on reasonable notice at CircleCI’s cost (or if the audits reveal material non-compliance with these TOS, at Licensee’s cost).</li>
      <li>For any upgrade in a subscription level for a month-to-month service plan, CircleCI shall automatically charge Licensee the new subscription fee, effective as of the date the service upgrade is requested and for each subsequent one-month recurring cycle pursuant to the billing method applicable to Licensee.  If CircleCI is providing Licensee the Service pursuant to a yearly service plan, CircleCI will immediately charge Licensee any increase in subscription level plan cost pursuant to the billing method applicable to Licensee, prorated for the remaining Term of Licensee’s yearly billing cycle; provided, however, any decrease in a subscription level plan cost shall only take effect upon the renewal date of the then current yearly service plan. Licensee’s downgrading its subscription level may cause the loss of features or capacity of Licensee’s Account.  CircleCI does not accept any liability for such loss.</li>
      <li>If any amount owing by Licensee under these TOS for the Service is thirty (30) or more days overdue (or ten (10) or more days overdue in the case of amounts Licensee has authorized CircleCI to charge to Licensee’s credit card), CircleCI may, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend Licensee’s and any User’s access to the Service and/or otherwise limit the functionality of the Service until such amounts are paid in full. </li>
      <li>Licensee agrees that its purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by CircleCI regarding future functionality or features.</li>

In the case of a free trial or CircleCI otherwise providing the Service at no cost to a Licensee, CircleCI shall have, upon Licensee or any Users failing to use the Service for more than six (6) consecutive months, the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate all User Accounts of Licensee and terminate Licensee’s and all Licensee’s Users’ access to and use of the Service without notice.  Upon expiration or termination of an Order or these TOS, Licensee shall immediately be unable access and use the Service, all Licensee Content may be deleted from the Service at CircleCI’s sole discretion (such information can not be recovered once Licensee’s Account or any User Account is terminated) and Licensee shall return or destroy all copies of all Content and all portions thereof in Licensee’s possession and so certify to CircleCI, if such certification is requested by CircleCI.  <span class="cross-reference">Sections 3(b)</span> and <span class="cross-reference">5 through 14</span> of these TOS, shall survive termination or expiration of these TOS.

CircleCI reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this <span class="cross-reference">Section 7</span>.
